# Steps for this re-creating this project on your own

1. Create react project with vite with TypeScript
2. Create folder for NodeJS project (Just create a folder, nothing else)

## Its best to work with Backend first. So move into backend folder and have a look at README file there!

## Once you feel the backend is somewhat ready, you can work on frontend!

### Do not work on backend and frontend simultaneusly. First create backend and then work on frontend!
